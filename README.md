# PyPost

PyPost acts as a virtual post office, allowing users to send letters formatted as HTML via email. The application mimics the experience of sending letters through the postal service, where delivery occurs without a guaranteed date and cannot be tracked.

> **Legend:**  
> This application was inspired by the greatest love I have ever had and the girl I love the most in the universe. 💌

## Running the Project

🛠️ Instructions on how to run PyPost _might appear here someday_…  
but in the meantime, just sit back, enjoy the code, and let the digital post office do its thing. 📬✨
