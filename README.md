# PyPost

PyPost acts as a virtual post office, allowing users to send letters formatted as HTML via email. The application mimics the experience of sending letters through the postal service, where delivery occurs without a guaranteed date and cannot be tracked. 

## Running the Project

but in the meantime, just sit back, enjoy the code, and let the digital post office do its thing. 📬✨
